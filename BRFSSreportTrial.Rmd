# Executive Summary

## Introduction

The overarching goal of this report is to gain experience writing reports of reproducible analyses in R Markdown.

The objective of this report is to reproduce the healthy sleep prevalence analyses from the 2014 BRFFS.  We will download the data used in the February 19, 2016 MMWR:  Liu Y, Wheaton AG, Chapman DP, Cunningham TJ, Lu H, Croft JB. Prevalence of Healthy Sleep Duration among Adults -- United States, 2014. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2016;65:137-141. DOI: <http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6506a1>.  Then we will verify the data against the numbers in the report and then reproduce the figure.

## Data and Methods

The BRFSS data from 2014 can be downloaded from the CDC as a zipped SAS file:
<http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2014/files/LLCP2014XPT.ZIP>.
    
We also need to reference the codebook for these data: <http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2014/pdf/codebook14_llcp.pdf>.
Additional information is available from the BRFSS 2014 Survey Data page <http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2014.html>.

We are measuring self-reported hours of sleep by adults ages 18 and older.  There are 464,664 in 2014 from which we will base this analysis.  We will exclude everyone who failed to report their sleep time (variable SLEPTIM1).  Because our goal is to reproduce some of the analysis for the 50 states and DC as well as draw a map, we will exclude Guam and Puerto Rico. The number of subjects in our analysis is 449,755.  We get 68.7% of adults are healthy sleepers.

Add some discussion about group sizes after the analysis is done.  Note that we believe we have the correct source data but we failed to reproduce the total, age group, gender or state-specific numbers in the table in the report.

## Results

This analysis did not do any testing.  Our map is consistent with but not identical to the one showed in the paper.  Like their results, we see a range of healthy sleeping percentages from 56-72% across states.  The highest percentages are in the northern states west of the Mississippi.  The lowest percentages are in the states east of the Mississippi.  

What summary files (if any) accompany this report?  

## Conclusions

Given the data, we were able to generally reproduce the MMWR analysis on health sleeping, but we weren't able to reproduce it exactly.  It appears that for some unknown reason the data we analyzed weren't the same subset of the (identical) orignal data.  We would need to contact the authors of the report to determine the reason for this.  We also note that we did not take into account the complex survey sampling design of BRFSS so we were not able to reproduce any error estimates.

For next steps it will be important to contact the authors at CDC and determine how we can align our analyses with theirs.

# Loading Libraries and Data

## Libraries

First we clear the workspace to eliminate conflicts.

```{r ClearWorkspace}
if (! isTRUE(getOption('knitr.in.progress'))) {
    closeAllConnections()
    rm(list=ls())
}
```

Next we load all of the R libraries we'll be using in this analysis.  No need to show the results in the report so we set `message=FALSE`.

```{r loadLibraries, message=FALSE}

# Create a vector of package names for the packages we will need.
pkgs <- c("foreign", "data.table", "dplyr", "tm", "XML", 
          "epitools", "Hmisc", "choroplethrMaps", "choroplethr", 
          "RColorBrewer", "ggplot2", "grid", "gridExtra")

# Install packages (if necessary).
for (pkg in pkgs) {
    if (! suppressWarnings(require(pkg, character.only=TRUE)) ) {
        install.packages(pkg, repos="http://cran.fhcrc.org", dependencies=TRUE)
        if (! suppressWarnings(require(pkg, character.only=TRUE)) ) {
            stop(paste(c("Can't load package: ", pkg, "!"), sep = ""))
        }
    }
}


```

Create the data folder if it does not already exist.
```{r CreateDataFolder}
datadir <- "data"
dir.create(file.path(datadir), showWarnings=FALSE, recursive=TRUE)
```

## Data

There are 3 datasets we load and use in this analysis:  **Describe HERE**

### Sleepers data:

Use cached data files, if present, or download and extract as needed.
```{r ReadSleepersData}

# Note: If you want the script to get all the data directly from the sources
#       on the web, just delete the "data" folder before running this script.
allsleepersfile <- 'data/state_age_sleep_2014.csv'
if (! file.exists(allsleepersfile)) {
    # Download the BRFSS data for 2014 from the CDC as a zipped SAS file.
    dataurl <- 'http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2014/files/LLCP2014XPT.ZIP'
    datafile <- 'data/LLCP2014XPT.ZIP'
    if (! file.exists(datafile)) {
        download.file(dataurl, datafile, mode='wb')
    }
    
    # Extract the SAS data file from the zip file.
    sasfile <- 'data/LLCP2014.XPT'
    if (! file.exists(sasfile)) {
        unzip(datafile, exdir='data')
        # Remove the space character at the end of filename if necessary.
        # This was found to be an issue in the 2014 BRFSS SAS data file.
        if (file.exists(paste(sasfile, " ", sep=""))) {
            file.rename(from=paste(sasfile, " ", sep=""), to=sasfile)
        }
    }
    
    # Import SAS file. Use data.table for improved performance over data.frame.
    # Note:  For SAS variables that start with the underscore character, R will 
    # put an X at the beginning of the variable name as the data is imported.
    brfss <- as.data.table(read.xport(sasfile))
    
    # Subset by the data we need to create the choropleth and export to CSV.
    all.sleepers <- brfss[, list(X_STATE, X_AGE80, SLEPTIM1)]
    write.csv(all.sleepers, allsleepersfile, row.names=FALSE)
    
    # Close brfss data.table to conserve memory.
    rm(brfss)
} else {
    # Read the CSV into a data.table.
    all.sleepers <- as.data.table(read.csv(allsleepersfile, header=TRUE))
}
```

### States data
Get state names to match up with the state codes in the BRFSS dataset
```{r StatesDataProcessing}
# Download the BRFSS codebook for 2014 from the CDC as a PDF file.
codebkurl <- 'http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2014/pdf/codebook14_llcp.pdf'
codebkfile <- 'data/codebook14_llcp.pdf'
if (! file.exists(codebkfile)) {
    download.file(codebkurl, codebkfile, mode='wb')
}

# Parse the codebook to get the state names and their codes.
# Note: readPDF() requires that you have pdftotext installed somewhere on your 
#       system in your PATH so that R will be able to execute it. You may find
#       pdftotext at: http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html
statesfile <- 'data/states_list.csv'
if (! file.exists(statesfile)) {
    
    # Read PDF into a list.
    pdf <- readPDF(control = list(text="-layout"))(elem=list(
        uri=codebkfile), language="en", id="id1")
    
    # Read the content into a vector of strings. (Adjust index as needed.)
    states.raw <- content(pdf)[19:89]
    
    # Filter out the lines which do not contain states and their codes.
    states.str <- states.raw[grepl("^\\s{2,6}\\d{1,}\\s+", states.raw)]
    
    # Parse the lines to get codes and state names into CSV format.
    states.csv <- gsub("^\\s+(\\d{1,2})\\s+(\\w+(?:\\s\\w+){,2}).*$", 
                       "\\1,\\2", states.str)
    
    # Read into a data.frame, label columns and write to a file for later use.
    states <- read.table(text=states.csv, sep=",", header=FALSE)
    names(states) <- c("StateNum", "State")
    write.csv(states, statesfile, row.names=FALSE)
    
} else {
    # Read the CSV into a data.frame.
    states <- read.csv(statesfile, header=TRUE)
}
```

### Age data
Get US standard population totals by single ages to use for age-adjustment

```{r GetAgeData}
# Get the 2000 US Standard Population (Census P25-1130), Single Ages to 99,
# to be used for age-adjustment. http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/faq.html#6
agesfile <- 'data/ages.csv'
if (! file.exists(agesfile)) {
    # Scrape a table from an NIH web page and save as CSV for later.
    agesurl <- 'http://seer.cancer.gov/stdpopulations/stdpop.singleages.html'
    agestbl <- readHTMLTable(agesurl)
    ages <- agestbl[[1]][2:102, c(1, 2)]
    row.names(ages) <- NULL
    names(ages) <- c("Age", "StdPop")
    ages$Age <- as.numeric(
        sapply(ages$Age, function (x) gsub("[+]? years$", "", x)))
    ages$StdPop <- as.numeric(
        sapply(ages$StdPop, function (x) gsub(",", "", x)))
    write.csv(ages, agesfile, row.names=FALSE)
} else {
    # Read the CSV into a data.frame.
    ages <- read.csv(agesfile, header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
}
```    


# Analysis

Perform sanity checks and subsetting of the sleepers data
```{r SleepersDataSanityChecks}

# Check the number of rows in the dataset. The BRFSS 2014 Survey Data page
# (http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2014.html), under "Data Files"
# states, "There are 464,664 records for 2014."
nrow(all.sleepers)

# Subset the data.table for only those repondents which reported sleep time.
# In other words, exclude "Don't know/Not Sure" and "Refused".
all.sleepers <- all.sleepers[SLEPTIM1 <= 24, ]

# Count respondents who reported hours of sleep per day.
# Check that this is the same value as reported in the CDC codebook, page 14.
# http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2014/pdf/codebook14_llcp.pdf
# Codebook reports: 458172 ("Number of hours [1-24]", "Frequency")
nrow(all.sleepers)

# Subset the data.table for only those respondents in the 50 states and DC.
# In other words, exclude Guam (X_STATE == 66) and Puerto Rico (X_STATE == 72). 
all.sleepers <- all.sleepers[X_STATE != 66 & X_STATE != 72, ]

# Count adult respondents in the 50 states and District of Columbia.
# The authors of the paper write, "CDC analyzed data from the 2014 Behavioral 
# Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to determine the prevalence of a 
# healthy sleep duration (>=7 hours) among 444,306 adult respondents in all 
# 50 states and the District of Columbia."
num.resp <- all.sleepers[X_AGE80 >= 18, .N]
num.resp

# Percent of these respondents who sleep at least 7 hours per 24-hour day.
# The authors say, "A total of 65.2% of respondents reported a healthy sleep 
# duration [>=7 hours]." NOTE: Our calculation here is just a crude prevalence.
all.sleepers[SLEPTIM1 >= 7 & X_AGE80 >= 18, 100*.N/num.resp]

# Sanity checks show respondent counts match BRFSS products but not the paper.
#
# Perhaps the discrepancy is due to a difference in software. The authors claim:
#
#   "Statistical software programs that account for the complex sampling design 
#    of the BRFSS were used for the analysis."
#
# Or maybe a different survey variable was used for respondent age.
   
```    
Comment on what we find.  **TODO**

Aggregate by state and age to get counts and prevalence of healthy sleepers
```{r AggregatebyState}
# Exctract the sleeping health (SLEPTIM1), count total respondents and also the 
# respondents who sleep at least 7 hours a day (SLEPTIM1 >= 7) by state and age.
sleepers <- all.sleepers[X_AGE80 >= 18, list(Respondents=.N,
                       HealthySleepers = sum(SLEPTIM1 >= 7, na.rm = TRUE)),
                       by=list(X_STATE, X_AGE80)]

# Order by state and age.
sleepers <- sleepers[order(X_STATE, X_AGE80)]

# Rename variables.
names(sleepers) <- c("StateNum", "Age", "Respondents", "HealthySleepers")

# Get some information about the dataset.
str(sleepers)

# View first and last rows.
sleepers

# View the healthy sleepers and respondents by age group and crude prevalence.
sleepers %>% transform(
    group=cut(Age, breaks=c(18, 25, 35, 45, 65, Inf), 
              right=FALSE, include.lowest=TRUE)) %>% 
    group_by(group) %>% 
    summarize_each(funs(sum), HealthySleepers, Respondents) %>% 
    rename(AgeGroup = group) %>%
    mutate(CrudePrevalence=HealthySleepers/Respondents)

```

Calculate age-adjusted prevalence of healthy sleep duration by state
```{r AgeAdjPrevalence}
# Merge with "sleepers" with "ages" to get standard population.
sleepers.pop <- merge(sleepers, ages, by="Age")

# View first and last rows.
sleepers.pop

# Create a wrapper function around the `ageadjust.direct()` function from
# the epitools package.
adjustAge <- function(state.num, data) {
    # Age-adjust for respondents in a specific state.
    adj <- as.vector(with(data[data$StateNum == state.num,],
                          ageadjust.direct(count=HealthySleepers,
                                           pop=Respondents, 
                                           stdpop=StdPop, 
                                           conf.level=0.95)))
    adj['StateNum'] <- state.num
    names(adj) <- c("crude.rate", "adj.rate", "lci", "uci", "StateNum")
    return(adj)
}

# Calculate the single-age adjustment for the US standard population, 2000.
sleepers.adj <- sapply(unique(sleepers.pop$StateNum),
                       function(x) adjustAge(x, sleepers.pop)) %>% t %>%
                       as.data.frame

# Store the adjusted prevalence as a percentage in a new column, "value".
sleepers.adj %>% mutate(value=adj.rate*100) %>% 
    select(StateNum, value) -> sleep.state.adj
```


Prepare map values data frame and look it over before plotting
```{r GetMapReady}
# Prepare states data.frame for use with cloroplethr by adding "region" column.
states <- mutate(states, region=tolower(State))

# Merge in the state names for use when making the choropleth map.
merge(states, sleep.state.adj) %>% select(region, value) -> map.values

# View the first and last few rows and a summary.
# Compare with the values in the State and % columns of TABLE 2 from
# the article: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6506a1.htm
head(map.values)
tail(map.values)
summary(map.values)

# List the groups that will be used in the 5-color choropleth map.
map.values[order(map.values$value),] %>% 
    mutate(group=cut2(value, g=5)) %>% group_by(group) %>% 
    dplyr::summarize(regions=n(), mean_value=round(mean(value), 1)) -> groups
groups

# D.C. will be too small on the map to see. Find it's group and print as text.
map.values %>% transform(group=cut2(value, g=5)) %>% 
    filter(region == "district of columbia") -> dc.value
dc.value

# Find color of DC as it would appear in the 5-level "Blues" choropleth map.
dc.value$color <- brewer.pal(5, "Blues")[
    which(groups$group %in% dc.value$group)]

```

Create chloropleth map
```{r DrawMap}
# Make the choropleth map with choroplethr, using 5 age-ranges.
choro <- StateChoropleth$new(map.values)
choro$set_num_colors(5)

# By default, the map labels states with values from the "region" variable.
# Remove the state labels to match the original map from the article.
choro$show_labels <- TRUE

# By default, we get a blue color palette, and the legend has value groups  
# ordered from low to high. The map in the article uses the reverse order.
# Reverse the order of the levels in the legend to match the original map.
# This method requires us to reset the color palette to match the original.
# NOTE: This causes Alaska to get the wrong color, so don't run this code. 
#choro$ggplot_scale <- scale_fill_manual("",
#    values=colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(5, "Blues"))(5),
#    guide=guide_legend(reverse=TRUE))

# Render the map with reversed, relocated, and resized legend.
us.sleep.map <- choro$render() + guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse=TRUE)) +
    theme(legend.position = c(0.87, 0.17), legend.key.size = unit(.60, "cm"))

# Add DC to the map as a square floating offshore above the legend.
us.sleep.map <- us.sleep.map + 
    geom_point(data = dc.value, shape=15, size=5, color=dc.value$color, 
               aes(x=-73, y=37)) + 
    geom_text(data=dc.value, aes(x=-71, y=37, label="DC"))

# Display the map.
print(us.sleep.map)

```


Save the map as a PNG file with title and data source credit (as footer)
```{r SaveMap}
